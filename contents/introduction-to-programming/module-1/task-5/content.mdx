# Variables, Data Types, and Memory

## Declaration and Assignment

You can think of variables as containers that hold data. In python, you can create a variable by declaring and assigning to it some value:

```py
x = "Can I have"
y = 5
z = "tacos please?"
print(x, y, z) # This outputs: Can I have 5 tacos please?
```

During assignment, the variable to which the data will be assigned to is always to the left of `=`. So a line such as `5 = x` is not valid code and will cause an error.

*Aside 1:* The `#` symbol tells the python interpreter that every character that follows it on that line is a comment. Comments are annotations within code that are not executed by the interpreter.

*Aside 2:* `print` can take multiple values and they will print each of them separated by an empty space! We will come back to this on a later module when we would talk about functions.

It's important to note that `=` denotes assignment, not equality! We are essentially telling the python interpreter to assign `5` as the value of `x`. To further illustrate this, take a look at the following snippet:

```py
x = 5
y = 10
x = y
```

At the end of the script, we have `x = 10` and `y = 10` because `x = y` is not asserting that `x` is equal to `y`, but rather that `y` is assigned to be the value of `x`

### Memory allocation

At a lower level, when we assign a value to a variable, say `x = 5`, Python allocates memory in the computer's RAM to store `5` at a unique location represented by some address. The variable `x` then serves as a pointer to that memory address where `5` is stored.  

## Primitive Data Types

## Type Casting

## Static vs. Dynamic Typing

You can also declare a variable without assigning any value to it. This is done by annotating a type for the variable:

```py
x: int # declaration
print(x) # this causes an error
x = 5 # assignment
```

In the above snippet, we declared `x` to be a variable of type `int` (short for integer) without assigning to it any value, and we cannot use `x` until we assign to it some value! You should know that Python is a **dynamically typed** language, which means that the types of your variables are inferred by the interpreter at runtime (when you run your script). On the other hand, languages like Java are **statically typed**, which means all variables must be annotated a type. Being a **dynamically typed** language, there is generally no reason to declare variables without assignment in Python.
